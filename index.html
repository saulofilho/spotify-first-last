      Over the last few decades, the sound of bands has changed dramatically â€” not always for better or worse, but undeniably in noticeable ways. Whether it's metalcore, punk, alternative rock, or even pop bands, the evolution in sound is often shaped not just by artistic growth, but also by changes in music production, technology, and industry trends.
